In order to view the game, pipe `main.py` into `display.py` and open `localhost:5000`
**Note** `display.py` takes it's info from the output of `main.py` (terrible, I know), so don't change any of the logging. 
Additional logging is ok as long as it doesn't match the selection criteria in `display.py`
