# Poker

Poker application writen in Python. Uses TKinter package for front end display.

The application uses machine learning algorithms to train the computer player, observing the outcomes of a fixed number of games (10 000 by default) the application uses these as to train a model for when it plays a person. This application of machine learning is in contrast to a traditional application which could use either hand coded rules or perhaps a probability table saving development time and providing a working application in days. Small updates could use this to test try different machine learning models against eachother
